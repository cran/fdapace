\title{PACE: Principal Analysis by Conditional Expectation}
\description{
PACE package for Functional Data Analysis and Empirical Dynamics.
}
\details{
PACE is a versatile package that provides implementation of various methods
of Functional Data Analysis (FDA) and Empirical Dynamics. The core of this
package is Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA), a key technique
for functional data analysis, for sparsely or densely sampled random
trajectories and time courses, via the Principal Analysis by Conditional
Estimation (PACE) algorithm. PACE is useful for the analysis of data that
have been generated by a sample of underlying (but usually not fully
observed) random trajectories. It does not rely on pre-smoothing of
trajectories, which is problematic if functional data are sparsely sampled.
PACE provides options for functional regression and correlation, for
Longitudinal Data Analysis, the analysis of stochastic processes from
samples of realized trajectories, and for the analysis of underlying
dynamics.
